# Diamond Eye

Image storing system. Cheap and simple. 

There are two variants of the app:

1. [Console application](./diamond_eye/README.md)

    When you only need to find the best variants out of many similar images. 
    
2. [Web based application](./diamond_eye_cli/README.md)

    When you want to browse images, add new ones and edit tags.
